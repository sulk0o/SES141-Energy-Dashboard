# SES141-Energy-Dashboard

Small energy dashboard for my final SES 141 project. Not a coding class, but I had some extra time on my hands and we were given full creative freedom, so I made a small little dashboard. Since it's a small school project, the data was hardcoded in for the 5 categories to keep it simple, no API calls. The link: https://ses141energy.netlify.app
